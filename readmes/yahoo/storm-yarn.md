## New features:

Based on the project developed by yahoo, we have added following new features.

1. We have updated the version of Apache Storm from 0.9.0 to 1.0.1.

2. We have added StormClusterChecker class, in order to monitor the storm cluster. It can adjust the number of supervisors based on the usage of system resources.

3. We have added the function, namely removeSupervisors() in order to monitor resources. Its functionality is just opposite to that of addSupervisors().

4. We have updated the logging framework from logback to log4j2.

## How to install and use
### Prerequisite
* Install Java 8 and Maven 3 first. These two software are necessary to compiling and packaging the source code of storm-on-yarn.

* Make sure [Hadoop YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html) have been properly launched. 

* The storm-on-yarn implementation does not include running Zookeeper on YARN. Make sure the Zookeeper service is independently launched beforehands.

### Download and build

1. Download the source code of storm-on-yarn, e.g., execute the command ``git clone <link> `` to get the source code.

2. Edit pom.xml in storm-on-yarn root directory to set the Hadoop version.

  ![pom.xml](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/editpom.png)

3. To package items, please execute the following command under storm-on-yarn root directory.
       
        mvn package

  You will see the following execution messages.

  If you want to skip the tests, please add ``-DskipTests ``.

       mvn package -DskipTests

### Deploy:

After compiling and building the whole project of storm-on-yarn, next you need to install storm-on-yarn and Storm on the Storm Client machine, which is used for submitting the YARN applications to YARN ResourceManager (RM) later.

Please refer to the following  guide, step by step to deploy on the Storm Client machine.

1. Copy the packaged storm-on-yarn project to Storm Client machine, downloading the project of [storm-1.0.1](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/storm/apache-storm-1.0.1/apache-storm-1.0.1.tar.gz). and put the decompressed project of storm-1.0.1 into same directory as the storm-on-yarn project.
  As shown below,

  ![stormHome](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/stormhome.png)

  So far, you have put storm-on-yarn and storm in the right place on Storm Client machine. You do not need to start running the Storm cluster, as this will be done by running storm-on-yarn later on.

2. When executing storm-on-yarn commands, commands like "storm-yarn", "storm" and etc., will be frequently called. Therefore, all paths to the bin files containing these executable commands must be included to the PATH environment variable.

  Hence you are suggested to add storm-1.0.1/bin and $(storm-on-yarn root directory)/bin to your PATH environment variable, like this:

  ![environment](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/environment.png)

3. Storm-on-yarn will replicate a copy of Storm code throughout all the nodes of the YARN cluster using HDFS. However, the location of where to fetch such copy is hard-coded into the Storm-on-YARN client. Therefore, you will have to manually prepare the copy inside HDFS.                                           
  The storm.zip file (the copy of Storm code) can be stored in HDFS under path "/lib/storm/[storm version]/storm.zip".
  
  Following commands illustrate how to upload the storm.zip from the local directory to "/lib/storm/1.0.1" in HDFS.

      hadoop fs -mkdir /lib 
      hadoop fs -mkdir /lib/storm
      hadoop fs -mkdir /lib/storm/1.0.1
      zip -r storm.zip storm-1.0.1
      hadoop fs -put storm.zip /lib/storm/1.0.1/

At this point, the deployment step is complete.

### Run:

Everything should be ready. Now you can start your storm-on-yarn project.

The storm-on-yarn project have a set of specify commands and it use **storm-yarn [command] -[arg] xxx** as the comman format.

To launch the cluster you can run

    storm-yarn launch [storm-yarn-configuration]

[storm-yarn-configuration], which is usually a .yaml file, including all the required configurations during the launch of the Storm cluster.

In this project, we provide two quick ways to create the storm-yarn-configuration file:

    a) Edit the storm.yaml file under storm-1.0.1/conf folder

    b) Copy the $(storm-on-yarn root directory)/src/main/master_defaults.yaml to storm-1.0.1/conf and rename it to master.yaml, and then edit it where necessary.

In the simplest case, the only configuration you need to add is the Zookeeper cluster information and set the port of supervisor:

![Configuration](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/config.png)

When you  write a right configure file and execute the command above, the Hadoop YARN will return a application ID, if you deploy completely right. like this:

![applicationid](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/applicationid.png)

And, you can see the graphic below on YARN UI and Storm UI respectively.

![yarnui](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/yarnui.png)

![stormui](https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm-yarn/blob/storm-1.0.1/image/stormui.png)

So far, the storm-on-yarn has run and you can submit topology.

You can run the following command to submit a topology.

      storm jar ***.jar topologyName <arg> -c nimbus=

For example :
        
      storm jar ~/WordCount2/testWord-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar storm.topology.WordCountTopology wordcount -c nimbus=192.168.1.25


### Other details:

1. storm-yarn has a number of new options for configuring the storm ApplicationManager (AM), e.g., 
    * master.initial-num-supervisors, which stands for the initial number of supervisors to launch with storm.
    * master.container.size-mb, which stands for the size of the containers to request (from the YARN RM).

2. The procedure of "storm-yarn launch" returns an Application ID, which uniquely identifies the newly launched Storm master. This Application ID will be used for accessing the Storm master.

  To obtain a storm.yaml from the newly launch Storm master, you can run

      storm-yarn getStormConfig <storm-yarn-config> --appId <Application-ID> --output <storm.yaml>

 storm.yaml will be retrieved from Storm master.  

3. For a full list of storm-yarn commands and options you can run

        storm-yarn help

4. Storm-on-yarn is now configured to use Netty for communication between spouts and bolts.

  It's pure JVM based, and thus OS independent.

  If you are running storm using zeromq (instead of Netty), you need to augment the standard storm.zip file the needed .so files. This can be done with the not ideally named create-tarball.sh script

      create-tarball.sh storm.zip

5. Ideally the storm.zip file is a world readable file installed by ops so there is only one copy in the distributed cache ever.
