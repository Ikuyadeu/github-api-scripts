# Overview
Yahoo Connected TV’s Device Communication model enables new and exciting TV-viewing experiences driven by the sophisticated controls available on today’s tablets, laptops, and mobile phones. A new generation of TV App capabilities is now available to consumers, including gesture-based, multi-display, and multi-user features for intensive gaming, multimedia, and social applications. 

This Device Communication platform supports two-way message-passing between Internet-enabled devices and connected TVs running the Yahoo Connected TV Platform. Keyboard, navigation, and app-specific messages can be communicated through a new protocol over a local network. 

The Yahoo Connected TV Device Communication Tools repository provides miscellaneous tools and utilities for development on Yahoo Connected TV's Device Communication platform.
