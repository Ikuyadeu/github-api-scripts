homebrew-livecheck
==================
This Tap used to house the `brew livecheck` command, which checks for newer versions of formulae in upstream locations. The command has been [migrated to Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8180) as an internal `dev-cmd`, and the `livecheck` blocks in the Livecheckable files have been [added to their respective formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/60324) in homebrew-core.
