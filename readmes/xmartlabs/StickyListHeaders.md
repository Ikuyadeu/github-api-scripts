StickyListHeaders-Nullable
=================

Fork of [StickyListHeaders](https://github.com/emilsjolander/StickyListHeaders) which allows null headers in order to treat this kind of list as a normal list, due to the fact that it doesn't inherit from ListView. This approach permits to do generalized operations with common lists (treated as null-headers-StickyListHeaders) and with StickyListHeaders.

Now is deprecated. Pass an invisible view as a header in the original library instead.
