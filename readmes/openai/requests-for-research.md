# Requests for Research

It's easy to get started in deep learning, with many
[resources](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-pick-up-Deep-Learning-skills-as-an-engineer)
to learn the latest techniques. But it's harder to know what problems
are worth working on.

This repository contains a living collection of important and fun
problems to help new people enter the field, and for enthusiastic
practitioners to hone their skills. Many will require inventing new
ideas.

Also check out our new list: [Requests for Research 2.0](https://blog.openai.com/requests-for-research-2/)

## If you've solved a problem

Please write up the problem in a Gist or paper, and open a pull
request linking it in a "solutions" section for the relevant
problem. (Alternatively, let us know about it in
[community chat](https://gitter.im/openai/research).)

The best solutions will contain both code and an explanation of your
methodology. Please also feel free to report things you tried that
didn't work, or anything else helpful to someone trying to learn how
to do their own deep learning research.

We'll accept multiple solutions to each problem, so long as each
solution is materially different.

## This repository

This respository hosts the source for the
[requests for research](https://openai.com/requests-for-research). Feel
free to open a pull request. Especially encouraged are:

- Suggestions for new problems
- Suggestions for improvements to existing problems
- Links to your solution.
