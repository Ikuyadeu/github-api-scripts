# Nylas Ruby SDK
The Nylas Communications Platform allows developers to quickly build features that connect to every inbox, calendar, and contacts book in the world. Nylas makes it easy to build an integration that can be completed in days, and provides pre-built security and compliance features, and a 99.9% guaranteed uptime. Integrations with the Nylas Communications Platform are secure, reliable, and easy to use and maintain.

Nylas provides REST APIs for [Email](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-email), [Calendar](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-calendar), and [Contacts](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-contacts), and the Ruby SDK is the quickest way to build your first integration using Ruby.

This is the GitHub repository for the Nylas Ruby SDK and is primarily for anyone who wants to make contributions to the SDK or install it from source. If you are looking to use Ruby to access the Nylas Email, Calendar, or Contacts API you should refer to our official [Ruby](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-ruby) [SDK Quickstart Guide](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-ruby).

# Install
## Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.3 or above.
- Ruby Frameworks: `rest-client`, `json`, `yajl-ruby`.

We support Rails 4.2 and above. A more detailed compatibility list can be found in our [list of Gemfiles](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-ruby/tree/master/gemfiles).

## Install

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nylas'

And then execute:

    bundle

To run scripts that use the Nylas Ruby SDK, install the nylas gem.

    gem install nylas

To install the SDK from source, clone this repo and install with bundle.

    git clone https://github.com/nylas/nylas-ruby.git && cd nylas-ruby
    bundle install
    
## MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan) Note

Apple stopped bundling OpenSSL with MacOS 10.11. However, one of the dependencies of this gem (EventMachine) requires it. If you're on El Capitan and are unable to install the gem, try running the following commands in a terminal:

```
sudo brew install openssl
sudo brew link openssl --force
gem install nylas
```

# Usage

To use this SDK, you first need to [sign up for a free Nylas developer account](https://nylas.com/register).

Then, follow our guide to [setup your first app and get your API access keys](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/get-your-developer-api-keys).

All of the functionality of the Nylas Communications Platform is available through the `API` object. To access data for an account thatâ€™s connected to Nylas, create a new API client object and pass the variables you gathered when you got your developer API keys. In the following example, replace `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your values.


    require 'nylas'
    
    nylas = Nylas::API.new(
        app_id: CLIENT_ID,
        app_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
        access_token: ACCESS_TOKEN
    )

Now, you can use `nylas` to access full email, calendar, and contacts functionality. For example, here is how you would print the subject line for the most recent email message to the console.


    message = nylas.messages.first
    puts(message.subject)
