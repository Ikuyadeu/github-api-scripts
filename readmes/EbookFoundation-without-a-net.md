# without-a-net

This was converted by calibre from the PDF. I removed running heads, cleaned up the stuff at the front, and added the new license info.

Todo:

- split into chapter files
- convert the chapter/section headings to <h*> tags
- style the quotations
- markup and style the infoboxes
- markup the ordered lists
- markup and style the captioned figures
