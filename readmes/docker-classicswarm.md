# Classic Swarm: a Docker-native clustering system

**Classic Swarm has been archived and is no longer actively developed. You may want to
use the Swarm mode built into the Docker Engine instead, or another orchestration system.**

Docker Swarm "Classic" is native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts
into a single, virtual host.

## Swarm Disambiguation

**Docker Swarm "Classic" standalone**: This project. A native clustering system for
Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual host using an
API proxy system. See [Docker Swarm overview](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/overview/).
It was Docker's first container orchestration project that began in 2014.

**[Swarmkit](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit)**: Cluster
management and orchestration features in Docker Engine 1.12 or later. When Swarmkit
is enabled we call Docker Engine running in swarm mode. See the
feature list: [Swarm mode overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).
This project focuses on micro-service architecture. It supports service
reconciliation, load balancing, service discovery, built-in certificate rotation, etc.
