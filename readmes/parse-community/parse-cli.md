The `Parse Command Line Tool` allows you to set up your Parse app's server-side code from the terminal.
You can deploy your server-side code to either Parse Cloud Code or Heroku Node.js.

Overview
--------
Parse Command Line Tool can be used to perform various actions on your Parse app.
It can be used to create new Parse apps, deploy Cloud Code to an app, view all releases for an app, etc.

To install `Parse Command Line Tool`, you can just type the following command.

NOTE: You should already have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed and GOPATH, GOROOT set to appropriate values.

```bash
  go get -t github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-cli
```

This installs a binary called `parse-cli` at `$GOPATH/bin`.
