Real-time Filter Demo
=====================

A Lumia example application demonstrating the use of the Lumia Imaging SDK for
real-time image effects. The effects are applied to the stream received from the
camera and shown in the viewfinder. This app does not support capturing photos.

This repository contains two separate implementation solutions:

[RealtimeFilterDemoWP](https://github.com/Microsoft/real-time-filter-demo/tree/master/RealtimeFilterDemoWP) - Real-time Filter Demo for Windows Phone 8

[RealtimeFilterDemoWindows](https://github.com/Microsoft/real-time-filter-demo/tree/master/RealtimeFilterDemoWindows) - Real-time Filter Demo for Windows and Windows Phone 8.1 |

These example applications are hosted in GitHub:
