# Chart.js public website + docs

This repo builds the Chart.js docs as a static site, and the www.chartjs.org homepage.

Tasks are managed via [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

This will set up file watchers, build the site and start a server on port 8080 for the website.
