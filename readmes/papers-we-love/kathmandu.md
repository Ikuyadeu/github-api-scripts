This is the repository for the Kathmandu chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/kathmandu/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

We are starting out PWL chapter at Kathmandu so that we can also be the part of this awesome PWL community. We believe in sharing of the knowledge. We will be conducting the meetups at various places in within Kathmandu and its adjacent places.

We are working on to make first meetup happen at November 22, 2015.
