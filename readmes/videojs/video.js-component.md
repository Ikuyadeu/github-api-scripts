## This repository is deprecated! Don't use it unless you're really, 100% sure you need to

There is a component.json file that stays up to date in the [main repo](https://github.com/videojs/video.js) now, so please use that. No PRs or issues will be accepted against this repo, as the only reason to use it at this point is if you need to install an old version of Video.js.

video.js-component
==================

Repo for bower and component(1) files

* [Main Video.js Repo](https://github.com/videojs/video.js)
* [Videojs.com](http://www.videojs.com)

[Why use a separate repo for component files?](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/issues/536)
