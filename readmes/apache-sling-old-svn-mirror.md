# Apache Sling main repository (obsolete)

This repository used to contain the Apache Sling git mirror. With the
[migration to Git](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3987)
the content is out of date and should not be relied upon.

This repository is still kept to prevent broken links from various
sites to pull requests or commits. Note that all git repositories
have been migrated with history, so there should be no reason
to clone this repository.

Please do not open pull requests, they will be ignored.

## New Code Location

The Apache Sling code has been migrated to a new structure with one repository per module. 

The starting point for the new code structure is the [Sling Aggregator](https://github.com/apache/sling-aggregator), or you can go to the [Sling Modules](https://github.com/apache/sling-aggregator/blob/master/docs/modules.md) page to see a list of the repositories.

For more information about the Apache Sling source repositories, see
the [project information](https://sling.apache.org/project-information.html#source-repository).
