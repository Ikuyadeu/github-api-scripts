#### Resources

* **PSModule** – lets you download Windows PowerShell modules from the PowerShell Gallery, "PSGallery" (e.g., https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2/ ), and install them on your computer.

* **PackageManagementSource** – lets you register or unregister a package source on your computer

####**Requirements**####

Before you install this package, you must be running  [Windows Management Framework 5.0 RTM(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395).

<br/>
####**Installation**####

To use the **PackageManagementProviderResource** module,
* Copy the content of the download to the $env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder.

To confirm installation,
* Run **Get-DSCResource** to verify that PackageManagement, NugetPackage, PackageManagementSource and PSModule are among the DSC Resources listed in your DSC resources.

<br/>
####**Building the Code**####

The code is a Windows PowerShell script and interpreted by the Windows PowerShell engine at runtime.

<br/>
####**Running Test**####

To test the modules, run the following commands. The NuGetPackage resource is used here as an example.
* cd $env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PackageManagementProviderResource\Test
* .\NugetPackage\NugetPackage.Get.Tests.ps1
* .\NugetPackage\NugetPackage.Set.Tests.ps1
* .\NugetPackage\NugetPackage.Test.Tests.ps1

You can repeat these commands similarly for testing PackageManagement, PSModule and PackageManagementSource DSC resources.
