# HuginnAgent [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/huginn/huginn_agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/huginn/huginn_agent) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/huginn/huginn_agent.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/huginn/huginn_agent)

This is a dependency for new external Huginn Agent Gems.

## Installation

It is recommended to have a [local development setup](https://github.com/huginn/huginn#local-installation) of Huginn running before starting to develop a Huginn Agent Gem.

```shell
gem install huginn_agent
```

### Creating a new Agent Gem

Use the provided generator to create a skeleton of the new Agent Gem.

```shell
huginn_agent new huginn_awesome_agent
```

You can now start developing the new Agent in `./huginn_awesome_agent`. An example Agent class skeleton is located in `./huginn_awesome_agent/lib/huginn_awesome_agent/awesome_agent.rb`.

Every Agent and ruby source file needs to be "registered", so that the `huginn_agent` can load them during the startup of Huginn. After creating new files add them in `lib/huginn_<your agent name>_agent.rb`:

```ruby
# use register to add more agents to Huginn
HuginnAgent.register 'path_to/<agent name>_agent'
# use load to require concern or other library classes
HuginnAgent.load 'path_to/concerns/<file name>'
```

You can add your Agent Gem to your Huginn instance for testing by adding it the to list of `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` in the Huginn `.env` file:

```
ADDITIONAL_GEMS=huginn_awesome_agent(path: /local/path/to/huginn_awesome_agent)
```

### Running the specs for the Agent Gem

Running `rake` will clone and set up Huginn in `spec/huginn` to run the specs of the Gem in Huginn as if it were a builtin Agent. The desired Huginn repository and branch can be modified in the `Rakefile`:

```ruby
HuginnAgent.load_tasks(branch: '<your branch>', remote: 'https://github.com/<github user>/huginn.git')
```

Make sure to delete the `spec/huginn` directory and re-run `rake` after changing the `remote` to update the Huginn source code.

After the setup is done, `rake spec` will only run the tests, without cloning Huginn again. To get code
coverage reports set the `COVERAGE` environment variable: `COVERAGE=true rake spec`
