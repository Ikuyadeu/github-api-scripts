OmniAuth Dropbox OAuth2
=======================

Strategy to authenticate Dropbox in OmniAuth.

It's using the OAuth2 from the [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers)

Usage
-----

Add the strategy to your `Gemfile` alongside OmniAuth:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth'
gem 'omniauth-dropbox-oauth2'
```

Integrate this strategy to your OmniAuth middleware.

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :dropbox_oauth2, ENV['DROPBOX_KEY'], ENV['DROPBOX_SECRET']
end
```

You need to add your key and secret.

Also remember to add the full callback path to your Dropbox App Console, for example: https://example.com/auth/dropbox_oauth2/callback

For more information check the [OmniAuth wiki](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki).

TODO
----
This is a wip, so there are many things to do:
* Add tests (I did it really quick just to use on a personal project and no tests, shame on me)
* Test all cases (I'm not an expert with OAuth, so maybe there's something I'm missing)
* Make sure it's an OK gem (It's my first gem, I don't know exactly what I was supposed to do, so, please help me :D)

Helping
-------

* Fork the project, make your changes and send me a pull request.
* Create an issue! :D
