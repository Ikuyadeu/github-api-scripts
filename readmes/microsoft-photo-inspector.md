Photo Inspector
===============

Photo Inspector is an example application on how to capture and process high
resolution photos (resolution depends on device hardware).

Capture a photo and slide your finger on the preview to bring up a loupe to zoom
right into pixel perfect details in the photo. Save a lower resolution copy of
the photo to the main Photos gallery while retaining the original maximum
resolution photo for later use. Share photos as lower resolution copies to 
online services like Facebook and Twitter.

The example has been developed with Silverlight for Windows Phone devices and
tested to work on Lumia devices with Windows Phone 8.1.

This example application is hosted in GitHub:
