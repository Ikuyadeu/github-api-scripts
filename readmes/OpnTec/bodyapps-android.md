## Project Setup

Main IDE used by the team is IntelliJ-based [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html). 
To get started, download and install Android Studio, then choose "Import Project" and navigate to the project
root. Studio should import the Gradle-based structure without much ado.

### Building

* Install Google Play Services and Google repository using SDK Manager  
* Restart Android Studio
* Now you are good to run the app on a connected device

Note: for testing in an emulator, see Emulator section below.

### Eclipse/ADT?

We feel very comfortable with Android Studio so far and see no need to use ADT. If you want to use
it anyway, please feel free to contribute patches and/or setup-instructions.

### Emulator

Project requires Play Services which are not available in all versions of the Emulator. We recommend
testing on a connected device or via [GenyMotion](http://www.genymotion.com/). When running, 
GenyMotion instances act like connected devices and can be selected via ADB during launch.

To install Play Store and subsequently Play Services, follow [the instructions here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20121883/how-to-install-google-play-service-in-the-genymotion-ubuntu-13-04-currently-i)

### Google API

To get information from Google API it is required to create project in Google developer console.  
* Go to [Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/project?authuser=0) then 
  go to projects tab and click on create project.  
* Enter a project name and create a project.  
* Then go into the project and navigate to APIs under APIs & auth tab
* Turn on Google+ API
* Go to Credentials  under APIs & auth tab and click on Create new client ID
* Click on Installed Application and select Android
* Give package name as fossasia.valentina.bodyapp.main and provide your SHA1 key
  (You can get SHA1 from Eclipse via Windows > Preferences > Android > build)
* Enable deep linking and click create client ID

### Sync
		
You can test the sync options manually by cloning the web application and running it on local host if you dont want to work with online web service. Simply change the baseURL in Sync.java class according to your local host address and port.


# Features of the app
* Can create and store measurement records.
* Can add images and notes to measurement records.
* Can sync measurement records with the server.
* Can download HDF file for measurement record.


# Packages
There are five folders (or packages) in the org.fashiontec.bodyapps package.
* db- Contains the classes that deal with creation of local database.
* main- Contains the classes dealing with screens of app
* models- Entity classes
* managers - Contains the classes dealing with database calls and connects entities with database.
* sync – Contains classes that deal with syncing measurement records with server.


# Activities
There are five main screens in the app. And there is an activity for each main screen. All of these activities are in the package org.fashiontec.bodyapps.main

## MainActivity
This is the landing activity of the app. Contains buttons which leads to other screens such as saved, create and settings. If there is no user logged in it generates an alert dialog and disable create and saved buttons. At the startup it initiates sync process if Auto sync is turned on.
### Methods :
* dialog(String title, String message) - Shows a alert dialog with given title and message
* onClick(View v) [override] - Handles the clicks of every Button
* onResume() [override] – Disable and enable buttons according to user’s log in state.

## SettingsActivity
This activity provides the screen to log in using Google. It takes user’s name and email from G Plus API and sends it to BodyApps server to create account for user and then get a ID for user. Then it saves those data in local database. When user is logged in, it displays user’s picture from G Plus, user’s name and user’s email. And it will display option to turn auto sync on or off.
### Methods :
* signInWithGplus() - Sign in the user to Google plus
* signOutFromGplus() - Sign out user from Google plus
* revokeGplusAccess() - Revoking access from Google plus
* updateUI(boolean isSignedIn) - Update the UI according to signed in or not
* getProfileInformation() – get profile info from G Plus when connected.
* onConnectionFailed(ConnectionResult result) [override]  -  Try to establish connection if failed
* onConnected(Bundle arg0) [override]  -  After connecting to Google invoke getProfileInformation(), and initiate connection to BodyApps server.
### Async Tasks :
* LoadProfileImage – Loads profile image from G Plus.
* HttpAsyncTaskUser – This task sends user data to BodyApps server and saves user details in local database according to server reply.

## CreateActivity
This activity provides screen to create a measurement record. It is a simple activity with no http calls and only contains two edit texts, two spinners and date picker dialog.

### Methods :
* updateLabel() – Update the date of birth label when a date is selected
* setData() – Check the validity of data entered by user.
* setMeasurement(String name, String email) - Creates a measurement object and person object using entered data and adds the person to database.
* getID() – Generate a UUID to assign as measurement ID
* closer() - Closes current view and opens MeasurementActivity
* dialog(String title, String message) - Shows a alert dialog with given title and message
 

## MeasurementActivity
This is the activity which handles adding measures to measurements. This is bit complex and contains one static activity and number of Fragments. If device is portrait mode the screen will only show icon grid and by clicking respective measurement set will open. If device is in landscape mode icon grid and measurement sets will be displayed side by side.

### Methods:
* DBSaver(Context context) - Saves the measurement to the database

### GridFragment
This Fragment handles the grid view which shows icons which lead groups of measures.

### Methods in GridFragment :
* viewSet(View view) - Sets the view according to the orientation of the device
* filledSet() – Sets the number of fields filled in each measures group
* chooseView(int index) – Choose which Fragment to load according to the clicked icon in icon grid.

### ItemActivity
Supporting activity which loads measurement set fragments when device in portrait mode.

Head, Neck, Shoulder, Chest, Arm, Hand, Leg, Trunk and Heights measurement groups or measurement sets. Each one these are Fragments and contains edit texts where user can enter respective measurements. Some of them contains spinners. These fragments will be loaded directly to MeasurementActivity if device is in landscape mode. Else they will be loaded to ItemActivity.
### Pics
This fragment deals with adding pictures to measurement record. It contains three buttons Front, Side and back. Clicking these buttons will open a dialog where user will be able select their image source or they can remove existing picture.
### Methods in Pics :
* captureImage() - Open camera to capture an image
* openImage() - Open gallery to choose a image
* removeImage() - Removes a added image

* dialog() - Display dialog with image options such as camera or from file

### Notes
This Fragment handles the additional notes added to measurement record.


## SavedActivity
This activity shows the list of measurements current user has created and it allows options such as edit, delete and getting HDF. This activity contains two Fragments and one static Activity.  If device is in portrait mode the screen will only show list of measurements and by clicking respective measurement it will show the contents.. If device is in landscape mode list and measurement contents will be displayed side by side.

### Methods:
* edit(String ID) - Go to edit View
* options(final String ID) - Pops a warning dialog before delete a measurement
