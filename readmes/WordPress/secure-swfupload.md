SWFUpload (Maintained for Security Fixes)
=========================================

This is a fork of the long-abandoned [SWFUpload project](https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/), maintained by WordPress and others to ensure that a secure version of SWFUpload exists.

**We strongly suggest you do not use SWFUpload. But if you must, use this fork.**

WordPress is maintaining a secure version of SWFUpload for use by WordPress plugins that have yet to be updated to use [Plupload](http://plupload.com/), our upload library of choice. Plupload is was written and is actively maintained by [Moxiecode](http://www.moxiecode.com/), the developers of [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/).

We do not condone the use of abandonware. We only wish to make the web a better place by ensuring that developers have access to a secure version of SWFUpload, when the only alternative may be to use insecure code.
