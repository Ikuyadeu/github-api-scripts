# Dashicons

Dashicons, the WordPress admin icon font. For the official documentation, please refer to the [WordPress Developer Resource](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/).


### Icon requests

The Dashicons project is no longer accepting icon requests. Here's why: [Next steps for Dashicons](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/04/20/next-steps-for-dashicons/).


### WordPress Bugs

For any bugs that appear within WordPress Core, please [create a new ticket on WordPress Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket). Use the "Administration" component and the "ui" focus when creating the new ticket, and be sure to include "Dashicons" somewhere in the text of the ticket.


## Setup

To build Dashicons, make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node JS</a> installed. Then type `npm run build` on the commandline to generate the minified SVG files and sprite.


## Adding an icon

Once you're installed, to add an icon, save an SVG in the `sources/svg` folder, then run the `npm run build` command on the commandline.

If you want to add your icon to the Dashicons library, open a new Pull Request here with the new SVG icon, and wait a review.

If you're adding an icon for [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/) specifically, add it inside the `sources/svg/gutenberg` folder. It will be processed for everything but the font files.
