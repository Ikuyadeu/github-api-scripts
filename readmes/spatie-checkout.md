## Installation

This package can be installed through Composer.

```
composer require spatie/checkout
```

There is a service provider you can make use of.

```php

// app/config/app.php

'providers' => [
    '...',
    'Spatie\Checkout\CheckoutServiceProvider'
];
```

This package also comes with a facade, which provides an easy way to use this class.


```php

// app/config/app.php

'aliases' => array(
	...
	'Checkout' => 'Spatie\Checkout\CheckoutFacade',
)
```

## Usage

You can store the order id using this method:

```php
    Checkout::setCurrentOrderId($yourOrderId);
```

Your order id will be stored in Laravel's session store.

You can retrieve the value with:

```php
    Checkout::getCurrentOrderId();
```

These methods are also provided:

* `Checkout::clearCurrentOrderId()`: Forget the previously stored value.
* `Checkout::isCurrentOrderId($orderId)`: Convenient method to determine if the given orderId is equal to the value stored with the previous call to `setCurrentOrderId`.
