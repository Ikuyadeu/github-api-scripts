## Meteor API Documentation - http://docs.meteor.com

This is a [hexo](https://hexo.io) static site used to generate the [Meteor API Docs](http://docs.meteor.com).

## Contributing

We'd love your contributions! Please send us Pull Requests or open issues on [github](https://github.com/meteor/docs). Also, read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/docs/blob/master/Contributing.md).

If you are making a larger contribution, you may need to run the site locally:

### Running locally

#### Submodules

This repo has two submodules, one the theme, the other full Meteor repository.

We have the Meteor repo to generate the `data.js` file (see below).

After cloning, or updating the repo, it makes sense to run

```
git submodule update --init
```

Generally you should not commit changes to the submodules, unless you know what you are doing.

#### Generating `data.js`

To generate the api boxes, the site uses a file `data/data.js` which is generated from the js docs in the [Meteor source code](https://github.com/meteor/meteor). This will automatically happen whenever you start your local hexo server.

#### Starting hexo

Ensure you've run `npm install`. Then simply `npm start`.
