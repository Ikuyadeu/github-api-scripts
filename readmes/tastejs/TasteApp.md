TasteApp
========

Taking [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) further with a more complex application. 

Please note that this project is still very much active. Wrapping up the design for a non-trivial application with community agreement on features has taken a while, but we feel we're there. We're now in the phases of discussing what the actual application will practically be and how to go about implementing.

See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tastejs/TasteApp/issues) for discussions around the new specification.
