# Backbone TodoMVC + ECMAScript 6

The `todomvc` directory contains an implementation of the Backbone TodoMVC app rewritten to use ES6 modules, classes and other features. Using the Traceur compiler, we're able to use these features in today's browsers with it being dynamically interpreted at runtime. 

## Docco compilation

* `npm install docco -g`
* `docco js/app.js` 
* Update the `docs` directory
