## Graphite + Carbon + Statsd + Grafana + Elasticsearch

An all-in-one image running graphite and carbon-cache and grafana.

This image contains a sensible default configuration of graphite and
carbon-cache. Starting this container will, by default, bind the the following
host ports:

- `80`: the graphite web interface
- `81`: the grafana web interface
- `2003`: the carbon-cache line receiver (the standard graphite protocol)
- `2004`: the carbon-cache pickle receiver
- `7002`: the carbon-cache query port (used by the web interface)


´´´
./build

./start
´´´

modify start to map to the ports and host directories you need.
