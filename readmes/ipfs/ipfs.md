## Quick summary

The IPFS project seeks to evolve the infrastructure of the Internet and the Web, with many things we've learned from successful systems, like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [BitTorrent](http://bittorrent.org/), [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/), and many, many more. This is the sort of thing that would have come out of ARPA/DARPA, IETF, or Bell Labs in another age. IPFS is a free, open-source project with thousands of contributors.

IPFS ([the InterPlanetary File System](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/)) is a hypermedia distribution **protocol** addressed by content and identities. It enables the creation of completely distributed applications, and in doing so aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. 

IPFS is a **distributed file system** that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to a single BitTorrent swarm exchanging Git objects. You can read more about its origins in the paper [IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true).

IPFS is becoming a **new major subsystem of the internet**. If built right, it could complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even more. Let's go point-by-point into how.

IPFS is a **protocol**:
- Defines a content-addressed file system
- Coordinates content delivery
- Combines Kademlia + BitTorrent + Git

IPFS is a **file system**:
- Has directories and files
- Is a mountable filesystem (via FUSE)

IPFS is a **web**:
- Can be used to view documents like the conventional web
- Files are accessible via HTTP at `https://ipfs.io/<path>`
- Browsers and extensions can learn to use the `ipfs://` URL or `dweb:/ipfs/` URI schemes directly
- Hash-addressed content guarantees authenticity

IPFS is **modular**:
- Connection layer over any network protocol
- Routing layer
- Uses a routing layer DHT (Kademlia/Coral)
- Uses a path-based naming service
- Uses a BitTorrent-inspired block exchange

IPFS uses **crypto**:
- Cryptographic-hash content addressing
- Block-level deduplication
- File integrity plus versioning
- File-system-level encryption plus signing support

IPFS is **p2p**:
- Worldwide peer-to-peer file transfers
- Completely decentralized architecture
- **No** central point of failure

IPFS is **a CDN**:
- Add a file to the file system locally, and it's now available to the world
- Caching-friendly (content-hash naming)
- BitTorrent-based bandwidth distribution

IPFS has **a name service**:
- IPNS, an SFS-inspired name system
- Global namespace based on PKI
- It serves to build trust chains
- It's compatible with other NSes
- Can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc to IPNS

## Current state of IPFS

**IPFS is a work in progress!** It is an ambitious plan to make the internet more free, open, secure, and high-performance. It builds on the good ideas of numerous battle-tested distributed systems.

Today, there is one main, reference IPFS protocol implementation (in [Go](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)) with [more on the way](#protocol-implementations) (including [JavaScript](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [Python](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs)).

### Try it out

The [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) implementation was released as an alpha distribution in February 2015 and since then has been making regular releases on the road to beta. Notably, [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) is also well along the way in progress. Want to get started with the IPFS alpha? Try these resources:

### A word on security

The IPFS protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. And — though IPFS is not production-ready yet — many people are already running nodes on their machines, so we take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments — for example, by exposing a remote execution exploit — please send your report privately to security@ipfs.io. **Please do not file a public issue.**

If the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited, or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly.

## Links and resources

The IPFS project is big (and expanding every day!), so we've excerpted some frequently-used links and other resources below. However, we encourage you to explore both the main [IPFS GitHub org](https://github.com/ipfs) (for core implementations and other mission-critical work) and the [IPFS Shipyard GitHub org](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard), home to incubated projects by the IPFS community.

### Protocol implementations

These are the current implementations of IPFS:

| Language | Project | Completeness |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Go | https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs | **reference** |
| JavaScript | https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs | **alpha** |

If you would you like to start your own language implementation of IPFS, check out the [Specifications](https://github.com/ipfs/specs). The specs are still evolving, but the core formats are stable and can be built on. Make sure to post an issue if you would like to start an effort, as many people have expressed interest in contributing to new implementations.

### HTTP client libraries

The following HTTP client libraries are either complete or under development. All welcome contributions! If you would like to create a new library, please see the [IPFS HTTP Client Implementation Guide](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/implement-api-bindings.md), and [tell us](https://discuss.ipfs.io/) so we can help.
