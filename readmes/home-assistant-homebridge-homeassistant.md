# :rotating_light: DEPRECATED :rotating_light:
homebridge-homeassistant has been deprecated since Home Assistant has natively supported
HomeKit since version 0.64. For more information on how to configure native HomeKit support
please see the documentation [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/homekit/).
We **STRONGLY** suggest to migrate to the Home Assistant HomeKit component.
