# Transactional: A payment platform wrapper

Initial goal: __Provide unified subscription, payment, dispute & refund across Stripe and Paypal__

Potential avenues in the future:
- Analytics for your revenue (like [Baremetrics](http://baremetrics.com), except multi-platform support)
- Support related functionality (similar to [ChargeDesk](https://chargedesk.com/))
