# Doctrine1 Documentation

This is reStructuredText transation of the Doctrine1 documentation, formerly at
http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/ (now the home of the Doctrine2
documentation).

Concentrating on the English documentation for now. Titles are mostly formatted
correctly, but most of the other formatting (code examples and the like) is
still missing. Pandoc was used for initial Markdown to reST.

Pull requests welcome.
