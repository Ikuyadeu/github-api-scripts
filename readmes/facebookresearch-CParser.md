# CParser

This pure Lua module implements (1) a standard compliant C
preprocessor with a couple useful extensions, and (2) a parser that
provides a Lua friendly description of all global declarations and
definitions in a C header or C program file.

The driver program `lcpp` invokes the preprocessor and outputs
preprocessed code. Although it can be used as a replacement for the
normal preprocessor, it is more useful as an extra preprocessing step
(see option `-Zpass` which is on by default.)  The same capabilities
are offered by functions `cparser.cpp` and `cparser.cppTokenIterator`
provided by the module `cparser`.

The driver program `lcdecl` analyzes a C header file and a C program
file and outputs a short descriptions of the declarations and
definitions. This program is mostly useful to understand the
representations produced by the `cparser` function
`cparser.declarationIterator`.

## Program `lcpp`

### Synopsis

```sh
    lcpp [options] inputfile.c [-o outputfile.c]
```
Preprocess file `inputfile.c` and write the preprocessed code into
file `outputfile.c` or to the standard output.

### Options

The following options are recognized:

- `-Werror`  
  Cause all warning to be treated as errors.
  Note that parsing cannot resume after an error.
  The parser simply throws a Lua error.

- `-w`   
  Do not print warning messages.

- `-D`*sym*`[=`*val*`]`  
   Define preprocessor symbol `sym` to value `val`.
   The default value of `val` is `1`.
   Note that it is possible to define function-like symbols
   with syntax `-Dsym(args)=val`.

- `-U`*sym*   
  Undefine preprocessor symbol `sym`.

- `-I`*dir*   
  Add directory `dir` to the search path for included files. Note
  that there is no default search path. When an include file is not
  found the include directive is simply ignored with a warning (but
  see also option `-Zpass`).  Therefore all include directives are
  ignored unless one uses option `-I` to specify the search path.

- `-I-`   
  Marks the beginning of the system include path. When an included
  file is given with angle brackets, (as in `#include <stdio.h>`),
  one only searches directories specified by the `-I` options that
  follow `-I-`. Therefore all these include directives are ignored
  unless one uses option `-I-` followed by one or more option `-I`.

- `-dM`   
  Instead of producing the preprocessed file,
  dumps all macros defined at the end of the parse.

- `-Zcppdef`   
  Run the native preprocessor using command `cpp -dM < dev/null`
  and copy its predefined symbols. This is useful when using
  `lcpp` as a full replacement for the standard preprocessor.

- `-Zpass`   
  This option is enabled by default (use `-Znopass` to disable)
  and indicates that the output of `lcpp` is going to be
  reprocessed by a C preprocessor and compiler.
  This option triggers the following behavior:

  * The preprocessor directives `#pragma` and `#ident`
    are copied verbatim into the output file.
  * When the included file cannot be found in the provided
    search path, the preprocessor directive `#include` is
    copied into the output file.
  * Preprocessor directives prefixed with a double `##` are copied
    verbatim into the output file with a single `#` prefix.  This
    feature is useful for `#if` directives that depend on symbols
    defined by unresolved `#include` directives.

- `-std=(c|gnu)(89|99|11)`  
  This option selects a C dialect.
  In the context of the preprocessor, this impacts
  the symbols predefined by `lcpp` and potentially enables
  GCC extensions of the variadic macro definition syntax.
  * Symbol `__CPARSER__` is always defined with value <1>.
  * Symbols `__STDC__` and `__STDC_VERSION__` are either defined by
    option `-Zcppdef` or take values suitable for the target C
    dialect.
  * Symbols `__GNUC__` and `__GNUC_MINOR__` are either defined by
    option `-Zcppdef` or are defined to values `4` and `2` if the
    target dialect starts with string `gnu`.
    
  This can be further adjusted using the `-D` or `-U` options.
  The default dialect is `gnu99`.
  

### Preprocessor extensions

The `lcpp` preprocessor implements several useful nonstandard features.
The main feature are multiline macros. The other features are mostly
here because they make multiline macros more useful.

####  String comparison in conditional expressions

The C standard specifies that the expressions following `#if`
directives are constant expressions of integral type. However this
processor also handles strings. The only valid operations on strings
are the equality and ordering comparisons. This is quite useful to
make special cases for certain values of the parameters of a multiline
macro, as shown later.

####  Multiline macros

Preprocessor directives `#defmacro` and `#endmacro` can be used to
define a function-like macro whose body spans several lines. The
`#defmacro` directive contains the macro name and a mandatory argument
list. The body of the macro is composed of all the following lines up
to the matching `#endmacro`. This offers several benefits:

* The line numbers of the macro-expansion is preserved. This ensures
  that the compiler produces error messages with meaningful line
  numbers.

* The multi-line macro can contain preprocessor directives.
  Conditional directives are very useful in this context.  Note
  however that preprocessor definitions (with `#define`, `#defmacro`,
  or `#undef`) nested inside multiline macros are only valid within
  the macro.

* The standard stringification `#` and token concatenation `##`
  operators can be used freely in the body of multiline macros.  Note
  that these operators only work with the parameters of the multiline
  macros and not with ordinary preprocessor definitions. This is
  consistent with the standard behavior of these operators in ordinary
  preprocessor macros.

  Example

```C
      #defmacro DEFINE_VDOT(TNAME, TYPE)
        TYPE TNAME##Vector_dot(TYPE *a, TYPE *b, int n)
        {
          /* try cblas */
        #if #TYPE == "float"
          return cblas_sdot(n, a, 1, b, 1);
        #elif #TYPE == "double"
          return cblas_ddot(n, a, 1, b, 1);
        #else
          int i;
          TYPE s = 0;
          for(i=0;i<n;i++)
            s += a[i] * b[i];
          return s;
        #endif
        }
      #endmacro

      DEFINE_VDOT(Float,float);
      DEFINE_VDOT(Double,double);
      DEFINE_VDOT(Int,int);
```

Details -- The values of the macro parameters are normally
macro-expanded before substituting them into the text of the
macro. However this macro-expansion does not happen when the
substitution occurs in the context of a stringification or token
concatenation operator.  All this is consistent with the standard. The
novelty is that this macro-expansion does not occur either when the
parameter appears in a nested preprocessor directive or multiline
macro.
	
More details -- The stringification operator only works when the next
non-space token is a macro parameter.  This provides a good way to
distinguish a nested directive from a stringification operator
appearing in the beginning of a line.

Even more details -- The standard mandates that the tokens generated
by a macro-expansion can be combined with the following tokens to
compose a new macro invocation. This is not allowed for multiline
macros. An error is signaled if the expansion of a multiline macro
generates an incomplete macro argument list.



####  Negative comma in variadic macros

Consider the following variadic macro

```C
     #define macro(msg, ...)  printf(msg, __VA_ARGS__)
```

The C standard says that it is an error to call this macro with only
one argument. Calling this macro with an empty second argument
--`macro(msg,)`-- leaves an annoying comma in the expansion
--`printf(msg,)`-- and causes a compiler syntax error.

This preprocessor accepts invocations of such a macro with a single
argument. The value of parameter `__VA_ARGS__` is then a so-called
negative comma, meaning that the preceding comma is eliminated when
this parameter appears in the macro definition between a comma and a
closing parenthesis.

####  Recursive macros

When a new invocation of the macro appears in the expansion of a
macro, the standard specifies that the preprocessor must rescan the
expansion but should not recursively expand the macro.  Although this
restriction is both wise and useful, there are rare cases where one
would like to use recursive macros.  As an experiment, this recursion
prevention feature is turned off when one defines a multiline macro
with `#defrecursivemacro` instead of `#defmacro`. Note that this might
prevent the preprocessor from terminating unless the macro eventually
takes a conditional branch that does not recursively invoke the macro.

## Program `lcdecl`


### Synopsis

```sh
    ldecl [options] inputfile.c [-o outputfile.txt]
```

Preprocess and parse file `inputfile.c`.
The output of a parser is a sequence of Lua data structures
representing each C definition or declaration encountered in the code.
Program `ldecl` prints each of them in two forms. The first form
directly represent the Lua tables composing the data structure. The
second form reconstructs a piece of C code representing the definition
or declaration of interest.

This program is mostly useful to people working with the Lua functions
offered by the `cparser` module because it provides a quick way to inspect
the resulting data structures.



### Options

Program `lcdecl` accepts all the preprocessing options
documented for program `lcpp`. It also accepts an additional
option `-T`*typename* and also adds to the meaning of
options `-Zpass` and `-std=`*dialect*.

- `-T`*typename*   
   Similar to `lcpp`, program `lcdecl` only reads the include files that
   are found along the path specified by the `-I` options. It is
   generally not desirable to read all include files because they
   often contain declarations that are not directly useful. This also
   means that the C parser may not be aware of type definitions found
   in ignored include files. Although the C syntax is sufficiently
   unambiguous to allow the parser to guess that an identifier is a
   type name rather than a variable name, this can lead to confusing
   error messages. Option `-T`*typename* can then be used to inform
   the parser than symbol `typename` represents a type and not a
   constant, a variable, or a function.

- `-Zpass`
   Unlike `lcpp`, program `lcdecl` processes the input file
   with option `-Zpass` off by default. Turning it on will
   just eliminate potentially useful warning messages.

- `-Ztag`
   This option causes `lcdecl` to treat all structs, unions, and enums
   as tagged types, possibly using synthetic tags of the form
   `__anon_XXXXX`. It is assumed that such names are not used anywhere
   in the parsed program. This is useful for certain code
   transformation applications.

- `-std=(c|gnu)(89|99|11)`  
   The dialect selection options also control whether the parser
   recognizes keywords introduced by later version of the C standard
   (e.g., `restrict`, `_Bool`, `_Complex`, `_Atomic`, `_Pragma`,
   `inline`) or by the GCC compiler (e.g., `asm`). Many of these
   keywords have a double-underline-delimited variant that is
   recognized in all cases (e.g, `__restrict__`).

Example.

Running `ldecl` on the following program

```C
const int size = (3+2)*2;
float arr[size];
typedef struct symtable_s { const char *name; SymVal value; } symtable_t;
void printSymbols(symtable_t *p, int n) { do_something(p,n); }
```

produces the following output (with very long lines).

```
+--------------------------
| Definition{where="test.c:2",intval=10,type=Qualified{t=Type{n="int"},const=true},name="size",init={..}}
| const int size = 10
+--------------------------
| Definition{where="test.c:3",type=Array{t=Type{n="float"},size=10},name="arr"}
| float arr[10]
+--------------------------
| TypeDef{sclass="[typetag]",where="test.c:4",type=Struct{Pair{Pointer{t=Qualified{t=Type{n="char"},const=true}},"name"},Pair{Type{n="SymVal"},"value"},n="symtable_s"},name="struct symtable_s"}
| [typetag] struct symtable_s{const char*name;SymVal value;}
+--------------------------
| TypeDef{sclass="typedef",where="test.c:4",type=Type{_def={..},n="struct symtable_s"},name="symtable_t"}
| typedef struct symtable_s symtable_t
+--------------------------
| Definition{where="test.c:5",type=Function{Pair{Pointer{t=Type{_def={..},n="symtable_t"}},"p"},Pair{Type{n="int"},"n"},t=Type{n="void"}},name="printSymbols",init={..}}
| void printSymbols(symtable_t*p,int n){..}
+--------------------------
```

## Module `cparser`

Module `cparser` exports the following functions:

### Preprocessing function


##### `cparser.cpp(filename, outputfile, options)`

Program `lcpp` is implemented by function `cparser.cpp`.

Calling this function preprocesses file `filename` and writes the
preprocessed code to the specified output.  The optional argument
`outputfile` can be a file name or a Lua file descriptor.  When this
argument is `nil`, the preprocessed code is written to the standard
output.  The optional argument `options` is an array of option
strings.  All the options documented with program `lcpp` are
supported.

##### `cparser.cppTokenIterator(options, lines, prefix)`

Calling this function produces two results:
* A token iterator function.
* A macro definition table.

Argument `options` is an array of options.
All the options documented for program `lcpp` are supported.
Argument `lines` is an iterator that returns input lines.
Lua provides many such iterators, including `io.lines(filename)` to
return the lines of the file named `filename` and `filedesc:lines()`
to return lines from the file descriptor `filedesc`. You can also use
`string.gmatch(somestring,'[^\n]+')` to return lines from string
`somestring`.

Each successive call of the token iterator function describes a token
of the preprocessed code by returning two strings.  The first string
represent the token text. The second string follows format
`"filename:lineno"` and indicates on which line the token was
found. The filename either is the argument `prefix` or is the actual
name of an included file. When all the tokens have been produced, the
token iterator function returns `nil`.

Each named entry of the macro definition table contains the definition
of the corresponding preprocessor macros. Function
`cparser.macroToString` can be used to reconstruct the macro
definition from this information.

Example:
```Lua
      ti,macros = cparser.cppTokenIterator(nil, io.lines('test/testmacro.c'), 'testmacro.c')
      for token,location in ti do
        print(token, location)
      end
      for symbol,_ in pairs(macros) do
        local s = cparser.macroToString(macros,symbol)
        if s then print(s) end
      end
```

##### `cparser.macroToString(macros,name)`

This function returns a string representing the definition
of the preprocessor macro `name` found in macro definition table `macros`.
It returns `nil` if no such macro is defined.
Note that the macro definition table contains named entries that
are not macro definitions but functions implementing
magic symbols such as `__FILE__` or `__LINE__`.



### Parsing functions

##### `cparser.parse(filename, outputfile, options)`

Program `lcdecl` is implemented by function `cparser.parse`.

Calling this function preprocesses and parses file `filename`, writing
a trace into the specified file. The optional argument `outputfile`
can be a file name or a Lua file descriptor.  When this argument is
`nil`, the preprocessed code is written to the standard output.  The
optional argument `options` is an array of option strings.  All the
options documented with program `lcdecl` are supported.


##### `cparser.declarationIterator(options, lines, prefix)`

Calling this function produces three results:
* A declaration iterator function.
* A symbol table.
* A macro definition table.

Argument `options` is an array of options.
All the options documented for program `lcdecl` are supported.
Argument `lines` is an iterator that returns input lines.
Lua provides many such iterators, including `io.lines(filename)` to
return the lines of the file named `filename` and `filedesc:lines()`
to return lines from the file descriptor `filedesc`. You can also use
`string.gmatch(somestring,'[^\n]+')` to return lines from string
`somestring`.

Each successive call of the declaration iterator function returns a Lua
data structure that represents a declaration, a definition, or certain
preprocessor events.  The format of these data structures is described
under function `cparser.declToString`.

The symbol table contains the definition of all the C language
identifiers defined or declared by the parsed files. Type names are
represented by the `Type{}` data structure documented under function
`cparser.typeToString`. Constants, variables, and functions are
represented by `Definition{}` or `Declaration{}` data structures
similar to those returned by the declaration iterator.

The macro definition table contains
the definition of the preprocessor macros.
See the documentation of function `macroToString` for details.

Example

```Lua
      di = cparser.declarationIterator(nil, io.lines('tests/testmacro.c'), 'testmacro.c')
      for decl in di do print(decl) print(">>", cparser.declToString(decl)) end
```


##### `cparser.typeToString(ty,nam)`

This function produces a string suitable for
declaring a variable `nam` with type `ty` in a C program.

Argument `ty` is a type data structure.
Argument `nam` should be a string representing a legal identifier.
However it defaults to `%s` in order to compute a format string
suitable for the standard Lua function `string.format`.

Module `cparser` represents each type with a tree whose nodes are Lua
tables tagged by their `tag` field.  These tables are equipped with a
convenient metatable method that prints them compactly by first
displaying the tag then the remaining fields using the standard Lua
construct.

For instance, the type `const int` is printed as
```Lua
      Qualified{t=Type{n="int"},const=true}
```
and corresponds to
```Lua
      {
        tag="Qualified",
        const=true,
        t= {
             tag="Type",
             n = "int"
           }
      }
```

The following tags are used to represent types.

* `Type{n=name}` is used to represent a named type `name`.  There is
  only one instance of each named type.  Names can be made of multiple
  keywords, such as `int` or `unsigned long int`, they can also be
  typedef identifiers, such as `size_t`, or composed names, such as
  `struct foo` or `enum bar`.  This construct can also contain a field
  `_def` that points to the definition of the named type if such a
  definition is known.

* `Qualified{t=basetype,...}` is used to represent a qualified variant
  of `basetype`. Fields named `const`, `volatile`, or `restrict` are
  set to true to represent the applicable type qualifiers. When the
  type appears in function parameters and the base type is a pointer,
  a field named `static` may contain the guaranteed array size.

* `Pointer{t=basetype}` is used to represent a pointer to an object of
  type `basetype`. This construct may also contains a field
  `block=true` to indicate that the pointer refers to a code block (a
  C extension found in Apple compilers) or a field `ref=true` to
  indicate a reference type (a C extension inspired by C++.)

* `Array{t=basetype,size=s}` is used to represent an array of object
  of type `basetype`. The optional field `size` contains the array
  size when an array size is specified. The size is usually an
  integer.  However there are situations in which the parser is unable
  to evaluate the size, for instance because it relies on the C
  keyword `sizeof(x)`.  In such cases, field `size` is a string
  containing a C expression for the size.

* `Struct{}` and `Union{}` are used to represent the corresponding C
  types. The optional field `n` contains the structure tag. Each entry
  is represented by a `Pair{type,name}` construct located at
  successive integer indices. This means that the type of the third entry
  of structure type `ty` can be accessed as `ty[3][1]` and the
  corresponding name is `ty[3][2]`.  In the case of `Struct{}` tables,
  the pairs optionally contain a field `bitfield` to indicate a
  bitfield size for the structure entry.  Field `bitfield` usually
  contains a small integer but can also contain a string representing
  a C expression (just like field `size` in the `Array{}` construct.)
  
* `Enum{}` is used to represent an enumerated type. The optional
  field `n` may contain the enumeration tag name. The enumeration
  constants are reprsented as `Pair{name,value}` located at
  successive integer indices. The second pair element is only
  given when the C code contains an explicit value. It can be an
  integer or an expression strint (just like field `size` in `Array{}`).

* `Function{t=returntype}` is used to represent functions returning an
  object of type `returntype`. Field `withoutProto` is set to `true`
  when the function does not provide a prototype.  Otherwise the
  arguments are described by `Pair{type,name}` located as integer
  indices. The prototype of variadic functions end with a
  `Pair{ellipsis=true}` to represent the `...` argument.

The `Qualified{}`, `Function{}`, `Struct{}`, `Union{}`, and `Enum{}`
tables may additionally have a field `attr` whose contents represents
attribute information, such as C11 attributes `[[...]]`, MSVC-style
attributes `__declspec(...)` or GNU attributes `__attribute__(...)`.
This is representing by an array containing all the attribute tokens
(on odd indices) and their locations (on even indices).


##### `cparser.stringToType(s)`

Parses string `s` as an abstract type name or a variable declaration
and returns the type object and possibly the variable name.  This
function returns `nil` when the string cannot be interpreted as a type
or a declaration, or when the declaration specifies a storage class.

Example

```Lua
      > return cparser.stringToType("int(*)(const char*)")
      Pointer{t=Function{Pair{Pointer{t=Qualified{const=true,t=Type{n="char"}}}},t=Type{n="int"}}}	nil
```      



##### `cparser.declToString(decl)`

This function produces a string that describes the data structures
returned by the declaration iterator.  There are in fact three kinds
of data structures.  All these structures have very similar fields.
In particular, field `where` always contains the location of the
definition or declaration.

* `TypeDef{name=n,sclass=s,type=ty}` represents a type definition.
  This construct is produced in two different situations.  When the C
  program contains a `typedef` keyword, field `sclass` contains the
  string `"typedef"`, field `name` contains the new type name, and
  field `type` contains the type description.  When the C program
  defines a tagged `struct`, `union`, or `enum` type, field `sclass`
  contains the string `"[typetag]"`, field `name` contains the tagged
  type name (e.g, `"struct foo"`), and field `type` contains the type
  definition (e.g., `Struct{...}`).

* `Declaration{name=n,sclass=s,type=ty,...}` represents the declaration
  of a variable or function that is defined elsewhere. Field `name`
  gives the variable or function name. Field `type` gives its type.
  Field `sclass` can be empty, `"extern"`, or `"static"`.

* `Definition{name=n,sclass=s,type=ty...}` represents the definition
  of a constant, a variable, or a function. Field `name` again gives
  the name, field `type` gives its type, field `sclass` gives its
  storage class, and field `init` may contain an array of tokens and
  token locations representing a variable initializer or a function
  body. Constant definitions may also have a field `intval` contaning
  the value of an integer constant. This field works like the size of
  an array: it often contains a small integer but can also contains a
  string representing the C expression that the parser was unable to
  evaluate for one reason or another. Enumeration constants are
  reported with storage class `"[enum]"` and with a constant integer
  type containing an additional field `_enum` that points to the
  corresponding enumerated type.

* `CppEvent{directive=dir,...}` describes certain preprocessor events
  that are potentially relevant to a C API. In particular, the
  definition of an object-like macro `s` with an integer value `v` is
  reported as `CppEvent{directive="define",name="s",intval=v}` and its
  deletion as `CppEvent{directive="undef",name="s"}`.  Finally,
  `CppEvent{directive="include",name="fspec"}` indicates that an
  include directive was not resolved.
