# Brackets-Standard

### This project does not currently work. We're looking for a maintainer who uses Brackets and `standard` and wants to help get this working again.

This is the brackets extension for the [standard] code style.

## Installation

Use the Brackets extension manager. Make sure you have `standard` installed globally!
