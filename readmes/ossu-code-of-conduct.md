OSSU provides an environment where all learners and contributors can feel safe and welcome. This document outlines our community policies and values.
# Rules
* Learn and help others learn.
* Be kind and courteous to your fellow OSSUnians.
* Criticize ideas, not people.
* Discuss publicly. Refrain from direct messaging people unless it is specifically requested.
* Ask questions; don't ask to ask. Thereâ€™s no need to write "Is there anyone that can help me with X?" Just ask about X.
# Prohibitions
* No violence or threats of violence of any kind.
* No sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any other prejudiced or discriminatory language or actions; this includes jokes.
* No sexual harrasment, including unwelcome sexual advances or offensive remarks about a person's sex.
* No cursing or swearing at other people (but feel free to use curses and swears about the #$%@ code, IDE, language, hardware or physics).
* No NSFW material. This includes nudity, gore, or any other potentially disturbing imagery.
* No revealing another's private information against their wishes (doxxing).
* No stalking or intimidation, online or otherwise.
* No spamming, trolling, flaming, or other disruptions of the peace.
* No inappropriate usernames. Moderators will change your name if it is found to be NSFW or derogatory.
* No advocating or threatening of any of the above behaviors.
# Reporting and Moderation
Moderators can be emailed at mods@ossu.dev. On the OSSU Discord server, users can use @moderator to alert the mod team about an issue in a channel.

If you see any behavior that goes against the Code of Conduct, report it to the moderation team as soon as possible, either privately or publicly.

Violation of the terms in this Code of Conduct will result in consequences that will depend on a) the severity of the violation, and b) history of violations. Possible consequences include: temporary mute, being kicked from participation, temporary or permanent banning from all future participation in the community.

If you feel that you have been treated unjustly, you may contact a moderator or community organizer and explain your grievance. Your grievance will be handled by moderator consensus.
