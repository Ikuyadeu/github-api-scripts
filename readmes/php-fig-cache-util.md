# PSR-6 Cache Utilities

![Quality Assurance](https://github.com/php-fig/cache-util/workflows/Quality%20Assurance/badge.svg)

This package contains a series of traits and base classes to cover the common,
boilerplate portions of implementing a PSR-6-compliant cache library.

This package also provides a basic in-memory-only PSR-6 implementation. While
not useful for actual use, it serves as a demo-implementation as well as a
debugging tool.

This package does not, and will not, provide a complete production-ready PSR-6
implementation.  If you are looking for a PSR-6 implementation, consult your
friendly local Packagist.org server.
