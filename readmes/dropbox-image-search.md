Image Search for Dropbox
========================

This source package contains the Literate Haskell source
of "Image Search," a hypothetical Dropbox API app.

Steps to run:

0.  Edit `ImageSearch.lhs` and add your own Dropbox API developer
    key and secret.
1.  Install the [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/).
2.  Verify that your Cabal `bin` directory (`~/.cabal/bin` on Linux)
    is in your `$PATH`.
3.  Inside the source directory run:

        $ cabal install

4.  Run `image-search`!

        $ image-search

Have fun!
