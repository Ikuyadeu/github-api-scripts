<H2>About Oracle .NET</H2>
This repository provides .NET code samples for Oracle developers, specifically for Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET)
and other Oracle .NET components. .NET products for Oracle Database are free of charge. They consist of:

<ul>
<li>Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) - an optimized ADO.NET data access provider to the Oracle database. ODP.NET allows developers to take advantage of advanced Oracle database functionality, including Real Application Clusters, XML DB, and self-updating client caches. ODP.NET offers three provider types: Core (for .NET Core), managed (100% managed code and easy deployment), and unmanaged (most comprehensive functionality).</li>
<li>Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio - a tightly integrated design-time "Add-in" for Microsoft Visual Studio that provides full Oracle .NET application lifecycle management, including PL/SQL debugging and schema comparison tools.</li>
<li>Oracle Providers for ASP.NET - a collection of ASP.NET providers that use Oracle Database as the data source. ASP.NET applications can store various types of website state in an Oracle database, which can then be shared across the application.</li>
<li>Oracle Database Extensions for .NET - a feature of Oracle Database on Windows that makes it easy to develop, deploy, and run stored procedures and functions written in a .NET managed language</li>
<li>Oracle TimesTen Data Provider for .NET - ODP.NET support for Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database (TimesTen) provides fast and efficient ADO.NET data access from .NET client applications to TimesTen databases.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Getting Started</H2>
Oracle .NET components are bundled together and installed as part of Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC). Downloads and installation instructions are available from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/downloads/index.html">OTN .NET Tech Center download page</a>. Beginners should download <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/utilsoft-086879.html">32-bit ODAC with Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio</a>, which will provide a guided, smoother installation experience. Installation instructions are available as part of each download page. The installation instructions list the software prerequisites for the version downloaded.

<H2>Tutorials</H2>
For beginning Oracle .NET developers, these <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/for-beginners/index.html">tutorials and videos</a> will assist you in developing .NET applications for Oracle Database. Instructions for compiling, testing, deploying, and running Oracle .NET apps are part of the  <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:24:0::NO::P24_CONTENT_ID,P24_PREV_PAGE:10117,1">Oracle By Example tutorials</a>.
