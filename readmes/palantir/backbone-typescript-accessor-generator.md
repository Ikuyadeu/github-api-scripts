# backbone-typescript-accessor-generator

> Generates Backbone models with typed subclasses for using Backbone.js with TypeScript and its type system.

## Getting Started
models are declared as YAML, such as

```YAML
Todo:
  content: string[]
  done: optional bool
  person: A

A:
  name: readonly string
```

and generates code in the form of

```ts
class _Model extends Backbone.Model {
  get_member() : member_type { return this.get('member'); }
  set_member(val : member_type) : void { this.set('member', val); }
  fromJSON(json) : { ... }
}
```

- members declared `optional` do not raise an exception if missing from a json loaded in fromJSON.

- members declared `readonly` do not have set_member generated.

the type for each member is a typescript type and must not contain spaces

Do not use the `_Model` classes directly!  Instead, you **must** subclass them.  For a minimal model, this typically means
```ts
class Model extends _Model {}
```
but usually you'll want to add methods.

## Grunt plugin
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-backbone-typescript-accessor-generator --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-backbone-typescript-accessor-generator');
```

## The "backbone_typescript_accessor_generator" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `backbone_typescript_accessor_generator` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  backbone_typescript_accessor_generator: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Usage Examples
```js
backbone_typescript_accessor_generator: {
  dynamic_mappings: {
    files: [
      {
        expand: true,
        cwd: 'ts/',
        src: '*.models.yml',
        dest: 'ts/',
        ext: '-models.ts'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
