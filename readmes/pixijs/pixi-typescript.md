## Typescript Definitions for Pixi.js ##

This definition file attempts to follow the [development branch of pixi](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/tree/dev) 

The pixi.js-tests.ts attempts to keep up with the [latest examples](https://github.com/pixijs/examples)

Any advice, suggestions or improvements would be appreciated.
