Asteroids.js
============

Based on the well know [Asteroids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29) game, this project introduces another way to pilot your ship using a mobile phone.

The original game was reimplemented in JavaScript and SVG with [RaphaÃ«l.js](http://raphaeljs.com/), and a custom gaming loop. The synchronization between the desktop and the mobile screens also uses JavaScript ([Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)). The mobile webapp uses [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/) for gesture and orientation detection.

It was developed in a single day (about 9 hours) during one of the [marmelab](http://marmelab.com) Hacking Days by [Emmanuel Quentin](https://github.com/manuquentin).
