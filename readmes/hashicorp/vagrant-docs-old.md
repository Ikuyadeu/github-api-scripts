# Legacy Vagrant Documentation

This contains the old Vagrant documentation for [docs.vagrantup.com](http://docs.vagrantup.com).
Pull requests and issues should still be opened against this repository
until the new design is up and running.

The contents of the site can be found in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant-docs-old/tree/gh-pages).
