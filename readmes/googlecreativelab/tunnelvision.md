# Tunnel Vision

Distort time and space by recording your surroundings through a collection of transformative filters. Each filter can be pinched or panned to alter your perception.

Tunnel Vision uses the [shadercam](http://github.com/googlecreativelab/shadercam) library to integrate the device's cameras with an OpenGL graphics pipeline. Frames from the camera are recorded to buffers and GLSL shaders are used to create textures that distribute time in the final composition.


## More Info


Tunnel Vision is built on top of another Android Experiment library called [shadercam](http://github.com/googlecreativelab/shadercam).
Go check it out to build more apps that use the latest camera2 apis with opengl shaders!

Check out more [Android Experiments](http://www.androidexperiments.com) and submit your own experiment!
