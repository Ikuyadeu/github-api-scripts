Meter is a data-driven wallpaper that displays the battery, wireless signal and notifications in a simple background visualization. It cycles through three visualizations and you can play with each wallpaper by tilting and moving the phone.

Meter comes with an application to enable a [NotificationListenerService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html) allowing the live wallpaper to listen to your notifications and displaying the third wallpaper.
