# ProMotion-push

ProMotion-push is push notification support, extracted from the
popular RubyMotion gem [ProMotion](https://github.com/infinitered/ProMotion) and was created by [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red), a web and mobile development company based in Portland, OR and San Francisco, CA. While you're welcome to use it, please note that we rely on the community to maintain it. We are happy to merge pull requests and release new versions but are no longer driving primary development.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'ProMotion-push'
```

## Usage

### AppDelegate

Include PM::DelegateNotifications to add a few methods to PM::Delegate.

```ruby
# app/app_delegate.rb
class AppDelegate < PM::Delegate
  include PM::DelegateNotifications

  def on_load(app, options)
    register_for_push_notifications :badge, :sound, :alert, :newsstand
    PM.logger.info registered_push_notifications
    # ...
  end

  def on_unload
    unregister_for_push_notifications
  end

  def on_push_registration(token, error)
    PM.logger.info token.description
  end

  def on_push_notification(notification, launched)
    PM.logger.info notification.to_json
  end
end
```

#### register_for_push_notifications(*types)

Method you can call to register your app for push notifications. You'll also want to implement
`on_push_notification` and `on_push_registration`.

```ruby
def on_load(app, options)
    register_for_push_notifications :badge, :sound, :alert, :newsstand # or :all
    # ...
end
```

#### unregister_for_push_notifications

Unregisters from all push notifications.

```ruby
def logging_out
  unregister_for_push_notifications
end
```

**NOTE:** From a screen you'll have to reference the app_delegate:

```ruby
def log_out
  app_delegate.unregister_for_push_notifications
end
```

#### on_push_registration(token, error)

Method that is called after you attempt to register for notifications. Either `token` or `error`
will be provided.

```ruby
def on_push_registration(token, error)
  if token
    # Push token to your server
  else
    # Display the error
  end
end
```

#### on_push_notification(notification, launched)

Method called when the app is launched via a notification or a notification is received
in-app. `notification` is a
[PM::PushNotification](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::PushNotification)
object which is a thin wrapper around the notification hash provided by iOS. `launched`
is a boolean letting you know whether the notification initiated your app's launch (true) or
if your app was already running (false).

```ruby
def on_push_notification(notification, launched)
  notification.to_json  # => '{"aps":{"alert":"My test notification","badge":3,"sound":"default"}, "custom": "Jamon Holmgren"}'
  notification.alert    # => "My test notification"
  notification.badge    # => 3
  notification.sound    # => "default"
  notification.custom   # => "Jamon Holmgren"
end
```

ProMotion-push automatically adds support for handling push notifications while your app is in the background. If your push notification payload includes `content-available: 1` then you may have an opportunity to pre-fetch data. The return value of the `on_push_notification` method should one of the following that best matches the result: `:new_data`, `:no_data`, `:failed`. The default is `:no_data`, so you don't need to return anything if you did not fetch any data. For example:

```ruby
# Payload:
# {
#   "aps": {
#     "content-available": 1,
#     "alert": "My test notification",
#     "badge": 3,
#     "sound": "default"
#   },
#   "type": "new_messages"
# }

def on_push_notification(notification, launched)
  if notification.type == "new_messages"
    MessagesScreen.load_data
    return :new_data
  end
end
```

#### registered_push_notifications

Returns the currently registered notifications as an array of symbols.

```ruby
def some_method
  registered_push_notifications # => [ :badge, :sound, :alert, :newsstand ]
end
```

### Actionable Notifications
As of IOS 8, notifications can include action buttons in the lock screen, notification banners and notification center. This is called the "Minimal" context and supports 2 actions. The "Default" context supports up to 4 Actions and applies when alerts are opened as popups.

To use these features with ProMotion-push you need to:

Define each action you plan to include in a notification for either context.
```ruby
    approve_action = UIMutableUserNotificationAction.new.tap do | action |
      action.identifier = "APPROVE_ACTION"
      action.title = "Approve"
      action.activationMode = UIUserNotificationActivationModeBackground
      action.authenticationRequired = false
    end
```

Register your actions by calling `register_push_notification_category` from your AppDelegate code prior to `register_for_push_notifications`, for each category of action you intend to use. Note that you must include a separate array for the actions to show in the minimal context.
```ruby
def on_load(app, options)
    register_push_notification_category 'APPROVAL_ACTIONS', [approve_action, deny_action, self_destruct_action], minimal: [approve_action]
    register_push_notification_category 'SECOND_CATEGORY_NAME', # ...
    # ...
    register_for_push_notifications :badge, :sound, :alert, :newsstand # or :all
    # ...
end
```

Include one of the categories you just defined in your push payload
```json
{
    "aps" :  {
        "alert" : "Do you approve?",
        "category" : "APPROVAL_ACTIONS"
    }
}
```

Implement `on_push_notification_action` in your AppDelegate to handle the selected action
```ruby
def on_push_notification_action(action, notification)
  # handle the action
  case action
  when 'APPROVE_ACTION'
    # approve
  when 'DENY_ACTION'
    # deny
  end
end
```

### ProMotion::PushNotification

You receive this object in your AppDelegate's `on_push_notification` method.

```ruby
def on_push_notification(notification, launched)
  notification.to_json  # => '{"aps":{"alert":"My test notification","badge":3,"sound":"default"}, "custom": "Jamon Holmgren"}'
  notification.alert    # => "My test notification"
  notification.badge    # => 3
  notification.sound    # => "default"
  notification.custom   # => "Jamon Holmgren"
end
```

The best way to test push notifications is on a device, but it's often useful to test
them in the simulator. We provide a way to do that from the REPL or in code.

```ruby
# In REPL
PM::PushNotification.simulate(alert: "My test", badge: 4, sound: "default", custom: "custom", launched: true)
```
```ruby
def on_push_notification(notification, launched)
  notification.aps # => { alert: "My test", badge: sound: "default"}
  notification.alert # => "My test"
  notification.custom # => 'custom'
end
```

#### alert

Returns the alert string for the push notification object.

```ruby
notification.alert    # => "My test notification"
```

#### badge

Returns the badge number for the push notification object, if it exists.

```ruby
notification.badge    # => 3
```

#### sound

Returns a string representing the sound for the push notification object, if it exists.

```ruby
notification.sound    # => "sound"
```

#### to_json

Returns a json string representation of the push notification object.

```ruby
notification.to_json  # => '{"aps":{"alert":"My test notification","sound":"default"},"custom":"something custom"}'
```

#### (custom methods)

A `method_missing` implementation will respond to all methods that are keys in the notification hash. It
will raise a NoMethodError if there isn't a corresponding key.

```ruby
# Given: '{"aps":{"alert":"My test notification","sound":"default"}, "my_custom_key": "My custom data"}'
notification.my_custom_key # => "My custom data"
notification.no_key_here # => NoMethodError
```

#### notification

Returns the raw notification object provided by iOS.

```ruby
notification.notification # => Hash
```
