# Discontinued

Starting with React 16.1.0, **we will no longer be publishing new releases on Bower.**

You can continue using Bower for old releases, or point your Bower configs to the [React UMD builds hosted on unpkg](https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html#using-a-cdn).

Those builds mirror npm releases and will continue to be updated.
