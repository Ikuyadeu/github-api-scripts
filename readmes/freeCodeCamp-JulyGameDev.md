# JulyGameDev

Camper Survival is a web based game developed entirely in Javascript. It was made by the FreeCodeCamp community 
during the live-streamed **July Game Dev** event! During which, viewers were able to join the c9 workspace and 
collaborate in real time with many of the seasoned programmers who were leading the way! Below is a list of all 
our amazing contributors!
