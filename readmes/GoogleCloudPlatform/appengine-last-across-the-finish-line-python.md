# Last Across the Finish Line

"Last Across the Finish Line" is an example application that uses the Task Queue
API to showcase a pattern for tracking asynchronous batch workers and notifying
a user when all the workers have completed.

This was described in detail in a three part [blog post][1] from one of the
Google App Engine team members.

The [pipeline API][2] is a higher level way to orchestrate task queues (this
has been merged since in the mapreduce API we ship with the SDK).

There is also a third-party library -- [fantasm][3] -- for doing similar
task queue orchestration.
