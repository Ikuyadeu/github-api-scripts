Futu Gear - the ultimate lap time scoreboard for your office wall
=================================================================

Office info screens are usually boring. If you're lucky to have one, it's most probably filled with stuff that doesn't interest you at all. Like financial numbers. Or your company website. Or whatever. Well, not anymore! Futu Gear enables you to display an infinite number of scrolling scoreboards filled with laptimes (of whatever game you wish to play). Fits at least workplaces with competitive-minded people, like ours.
