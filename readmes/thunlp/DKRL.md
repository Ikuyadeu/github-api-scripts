New: Add entity type information 


# INTRODUCTION

Description-Embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (DKRL)

Representation Learning of Knowledge Graphs with Entity Descriptions (AAAI'16)

# COMPILE

Just type make in the folder ./


# NOTE

Pre-trained embeddings for entity/relation/word are optional.
We update both Structure-based Representations and Description-based Representations in this version. We can also fix Structure-based Representations pre-trained by other models and only update Description-based Representations.


# DATA

FB15k is published by the author of the paper "Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data (2013)."
