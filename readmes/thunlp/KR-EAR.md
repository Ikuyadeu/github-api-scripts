DATA
==========

We provide FB24k dataset used for the task knowledge base completion in data.zip, using the input format required by our codes. 


Datasets are required in the folder data/ in the following format, containing nights files:



+ train-rel.txt: training file of relations, format (e1, e2, rel).

+ test-rel.txt: test file of relations, same format as train-rel.txt.

+ train-attr.txt: training file of attributes, format (e1, val, attar).

+ test-attr.txt: test file of attributes, same format as train-attr.txt.

+ entity2id.txt: all entities and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ relation2id.txt: all relations and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ attribute2id.txt: all attributes and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ val2id.txt: : all values and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ attribute_val.txt: the value set of each attribute

Code
==========

The codes are in the folder KR-EAR(TransE)/, KR-EAR(TransR)/.


COMPILE
==========

Just type make in the folder ./

RUN
==========

You need to  type the following command in each model folder:

For training:

	./main

For testing:

	./test

	./test_attr

You can also change the parameters when training.

-n : the embedding size of entities, relations

-m :  the embedding size of values 

-margin: the margin length
