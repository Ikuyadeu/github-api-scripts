ionic-site
==========

Repo for the ionicframework.com site.  To preview local Ionic changes, follow the instructions at the [Ionic repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic#documentation).

## No Docs Here

Ionic Docs are in a [separate repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/). This site is primarily used for general communications and promotion of Ionic framework and related products and services. 

## Local Build

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` (after the first run, this is the only step needed)


## Third Party Libraries

3rd part libraries should be concatenated into the site bundle by adding them via package.json and specifying what files to include in the `assets/3rd-party-libs.json` file. 


## Deploy

Changes to master are automatically deployed to  [staging.ionicframework.com/](https://staging.ionicframework.com/). Periodically, the Ionic team will inspect staging and promote it to [ionicframework.com](https://ionicframework.com).
